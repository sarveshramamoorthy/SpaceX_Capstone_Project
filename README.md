# SpaceX_Capstone_Project

**About**

I predicted if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

**Process**

The data was collected from two sources:
* SpaceX REST API
* Webscraping from Wikipedia

Then the data was wrangled to suit the problem solution and Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted using SQL and also by plotting different data points. 
The geo data was visualised using Folium and an interactive dashboard was built using Dash.

Different classification models were used and the best one was selected.


**Note**: This repository contains various notebooks for different stages of the project pipeline. This was carried out as a part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certification. The certification can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/B4KCHDMJY8SL).
